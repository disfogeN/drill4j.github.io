# JIRA
To track bugs, handle tasks and agile project management we are using EPAM's JIRA system.

You can get the invitation to Drill4J workspace from our Project Manager.

Once you'll get some tasks, after planning session, the workflow is:

1. Estimate it in hours.
2. Move in 'In Progress' column.
3. Each day you should log your work in hours until the task will be completed.
4. Send Pull Request (next PR) in GitHub.
5. Wait (work with other tasks) until you PR will be reviewed.
6. If you Pull Request rejected and requires changes, you should fix it, log time and repeat that step until your PR will be approved, merged and changes will be deployed to the server.
7. Move task to Testing column.
8. If your task becomes reopened please repeat 2-7 steps, until your task will pass QA check.
